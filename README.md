# Week 7 Practice Exercises

This week, there are several exercise for you to practice what you have learned
in class.  Each exercise is required.

## Required Exercises

There are three exercises to complete:

1. **binary-file-info**: Write a program that accepts the name of a binary file from 
standard input, and prints out the name, size, and type of the file.

2. **count-file-lines**: Write a program that takes in the name of a file as input, then
prints out the number of lines in that file. As an option, it can also take in a string
to filter the lines. If a string is provided, it should only count the lines that contain that string.

Follow the instructions in the `README` in each of the corresponding subdirectories to
implement and test your solution.

## Testing

Each exercise's README file contains instructions for testing the individual exercise.
Once you pass all the tests for all the exercises, you are ready to submit to Gradescope.

## Submission

In order to get credit for your project, you must:

- push your code to Github Classroom
- submit your work in Gradescope
- submit your project in Woolf

Note that this assignment is automatically graded. You will see your grade shortly
after submitting to Gradescope. You have unlimited number of attempts, therefore you are encouraged
to modify your work and resubmit as much as needed, before the due date.
